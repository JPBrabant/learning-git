# Repo and files

## General information

### Tracked vs untracked

Tracked files are files that were in the last snapshot, as well as any newly staged files; they can be unmodified, modified, or staged. In short, tracked files are files that Git knows about.

Untracked files are everything else — any files in your working directory that were not in your last snapshot and are not in your staging area.

### Flow

- Stash — A place to hide modifications.
- Workspace — The current working directory (a file system directory).
- Index — Staging area, sometime called the cache. 
- Local repository — The repo (the .git folder containing all the data about your project).
- Upstream respository — The remote repository. It's default name is origin.

### Special argument `--` 

Most command support a special argument with 2 dash `--` as the next to last argument. Usually, this is followed by a list of files. Those files could have a name that start with a dash and git could confuse it as an argument. Using those 2 dash protect agaist this situation. 

## `init` and `clone`

Start an empty repo from the current directory.

```Shell
git init
```

Clone a repo (from *Github*, *Azure DevOps*, ...) inside the current directory.

```Shell
git clone https://...
```

### Gitignore

The first file you put inside your repo should be a `.gitignore` from [Github](https://github.com/github/gitignore).

## `add`

To start tracking file and to add them to the staging area use 

```Shell
git add <file1> <file2> ...
```

Unknow file (new file) will start beeing tracked by git and known files will be added to the staging aread.

You can use pattern like `*.css`, `.` (the current directory) or `/directory name`.

## `commit`

Save all staged files with

```Shell
git commit -m "Message"
```

You can omit the `-m` option and it will open a text editor to write your message in. It's usefull for multiline message.

## `rm`

To track a delete operation in git, and to remove the file from the file system use

```Shell
git rm <file1> <file2> ...
```

If the file was never tracked by git, meaning it was never commited, you need to use the `force` option. Git stop you from doing that with `-f` because it will not be possible the restore the file.

```Shell
git rm -f <file1> <file2> ...
```

Finaly, to remove a file from the staging area 

```Shell
git rm --cached <file1> <file2> ...
```

## `mv`
