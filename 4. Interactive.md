# Interactive rebase

TODO : <https://git-scm.com/docs/git-rebase#_interactive_mode>

```Shell
pick f59cc0a # Commit message (oldest commit, will be applied first)
pick 08cd474 # Commit message
pick 117c1ad # Commit message
pick 1f3a94a # Commit message (newest commit will be applied last)

# Rebase 8d90491..1f3a94a onto 8d90491 (4 commands)
#
# Commands:
# p, pick <commit> = use commit
# r, reword <commit> = use commit, but edit the commit message
# e, edit <commit> = use commit, but stop for amending
# s, squash <commit> = use commit, but meld into previous commit
# f, fixup [-C | -c] <commit> = like "squash" but keep only the previous
#                    commit's log message, unless -C is used, in which case
#                    keep only this commit's message; -c is same as -C but
#                    opens the editor
# x, exec <command> = run command (the rest of the line) using shell
# b, break = stop here (continue rebase later with 'git rebase --continue')
# d, drop <commit> = remove commit
# l, label <label> = label current HEAD with a name
# t, reset <label> = reset HEAD to a label
# m, merge [-C <commit> | -c <commit>] <label> [# <oneline>]
#         create a merge commit using the original merge commit's
#         message (or the oneline, if no original merge commit was
#         specified); use -c <commit> to reword the commit message
# u, update-ref <ref> = track a placeholder for the <ref> to be updated
#                       to this position in the new commits. The <ref> is
#                       updated at the end of the rebase
#
# These lines can be re-ordered; they are executed from top to bottom.
#
# If you remove a line here THAT COMMIT WILL BE LOST.
#
# However, if you remove everything, the rebase will be aborted.
#
```

- status — gives you a status output, showing you how many added and removed lines there are in each file (split up between staged and unstaged changes)
- update — allows you to stage complete files into the index
- revert — allows you to unstage changes from the index, again operating on whole files
- add — untracked allows you to (you guessed it) add untracked files
- patch — does the same thing as --patch
- diff — shows you a diff between the index and HEAD
