# Git basics

## General information

### Tracked vs untracked

Tracked files are files that were in the last snapshot, as well as any newly staged files; they can be unmodified, modified, or staged. In short, tracked files are files that Git knows about.

Untracked files are everything else — any files in your working directory that were not in your last snapshot and are not in your staging area.

### Flow

- **Stash** — A place to hide modifications.
- **Workspace** — The current working directory / working tree (a file system directory).
- **Index** — Staging area, sometime called the cache. 
- **Local repository** — The repo (the .git folder containing all the data about your project).
- **Upstream respository** — The remote repository. It's default name is origin.

### Special argument `--` 

Most command support a special argument with 2 dash `--` as the next to last argument. Usually, this is followed by a list of files. Those files could have a name that start with a dash and git could confuse it as an argument. Using those 2 dash protect agaist this situation.
