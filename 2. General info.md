# General information

## Tracked vs untracked

Tracked files are files that were in the last snapshot, as well as any newly staged files; they can be unmodified, modified, or staged. In short, tracked files are files that Git knows about.

Untracked files are everything else — any files in your working directory that were not in your last snapshot and are not in your staging area.

## Flow

- **Stash** — A place to hide modifications.
- **Workspace** — The current working directory / working tree (a file system directory).
- **Index** — Staging area, sometime called the cache. 
- **Local repository** — The repo (the .git folder containing all the data about your project).
- **Upstream respository** — The remote repository. It's default name is origin.

## Special argument `--` 

Most command support a special argument with 2 dash `--` as the next to last argument. Usually, this is followed by a list of files. Those files could have a name that start with a dash and git could confuse it as an argument. Using those 2 dash protect agaist this situation. 

## Reference

All commit have a unique SHA-1 hash. The first 5 caracters are usually enough to uniqly identify a commit. 

There exist a defaut HEAD, that is a symbolic reference to the branch you are currently working on. If you checkout a remote branch, you will be in detached HEAD state meaning HEAD will direclty point to a commit and not a branch because you cannot move a remote branch. 

Tag are name that you give to certain commit using `git tag <tagName> <commitHash>`. There is a concept of annotated tag and having a tag message but I don't think it's usefull. 

```Shell
git tag -a <tagName> <commitHash> -m "Comment line 1" -m "Comment line 2" ...

git show <tagName>
```

There is remote reference like origin/main. Origin is the remote repo and /main is the branch on origin. Those branch are read only. If you git switch to them, HEAD will point to the underlying commit, and not the branch. Doing a commit will not move the branch. 

Finaly there are relative reference. 

```Shell
git show s9419^ # Parent of commit s9419
git show HEAD^  # Parent of HEAD
git show HEAD^2 # 2nd parent of HEAD in case of a merge
git show HEAD~2 # Grand parent of HEAD
git show HEAD~3 # Grand grand parent of HEAD
```
