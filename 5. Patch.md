# Patch option

`(-p|--patch)`

> Stage this hunk [y/n/a/d/K/j/J/e/?]?

y — Yes, add this hunk
n — No, don’t add this hunk
d — No, don’t add this hunk and all other remaining hunks. Useful if you’ve already added what you want to, and want to skip over the rest
s — Split the hunk into smaller hunks. This only works if there’s unchanged lines between the changes in the displayed hunk, so this wouldn’t have any effect in the example above
e — Manually edit the hunk. This is probably the most powerful option. As promised, it will open the hunk in a text editor and you can edit it to your hearts content
