# Branches

## Before we begin

### Deprecated `git checkout`

A lot of tutorial online use `git checkout`, but with version 2.23 of git, released in 2019, they introduced 2 new commands to split it functionnality : `git switch` and `git restore`. I will be using them.

### Branch often

When working on a feature, start a new branch, that way, if a bug arise in production, you can switch back to main, create a fix and push it in production without having what you are currently working on interfering. 

## Fast foward

When merging or rebasing, you pull stuff toward you. If the branch you pull is lower on the tree, you will fast-foward your current branch name down to where you pulled (the other branch).
