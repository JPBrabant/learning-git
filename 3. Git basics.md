# Git basics

## Starting a new repo

Start an empty repo from the current directory.

```Shell
git init
```

Clone a repo (from *Github*, *Azure DevOps*, ...) inside the current directory.

```Shell
git clone https://...
```

### Gitignore

The first file you put inside your repo should be a `.gitignore` from [Github](https://github.com/github/gitignore).

## The staging area

To start tracking file and to add them to the staging area use 

```Shell
git add <file1> <file2> ...
```

Unknow file (new file) will start beeing tracked by git and known files will be added to the staging area (the index).

You can use pattern like `*.css`, `.` (the current directory) or `/directory name`.

You can remove file from staging with

```Shell
git restore --staged <file>
```

Save all staged files with

```Shell
git commit -m "Message"
```

If you forgot something in your last commit, or what to rewrite the commit message, use 

```Shell
git commit --amend
```

You can omit the `-m` option and it will open a text editor to write your message in. It's usefull for multiline message.

To track a delete operation in git, and to remove the file from the file system use `rm`. The delete operation wil also automaticaly be staged.

```Shell
git rm <file1> <file2> ...
```

If the file was never tracked by git, meaning it was never commited, you need to use the `force` option. Git stop you from doing that with `-f` because it will not be possible the restore the file.

Furthermore, you can mark a file for deletion but keep it in your working directory. Meaning it will be deleted for git, but it will still be on your files system.

```Shell
git rm --cached <file>
```

Move or rename a file : 

```Shell
git mv <sourceFile> <destinationFile>
```

## Undoing mistake

Undoing something in your current working directory.

```Shell
git restore <file>
```

## Getting info about your repository

This command tell you your current branch, if it is up to date with origin, and the state of all untracked and tracked files.

```Shell
git status
```

```Shell
git log

git log --pretty=format:"%h - %an, %ar : %s"

git log --pretty=format:"[%h] %s %d" --graph
```

```Shell
git log -S "codeSnippet" # Search in the code and show commit that changed that code

git log <file> # File or directory to see only commit of those files. 

git log --grep "message" # Search commit that contain that string in the commit message.
```

```Shell
git show <commit,tag,branch>
```

# TODO

To see what you’ve changed but not yet staged

If you want to see what you’ve staged that will go into your next commit
git diff --staged
